# Ciliary Motion Metrics

These are a series of open sourced scripts for computing quantitative metrics of ciliary motion. Those will be documented more thoroughly as they are tested and included in the master branch.

Currently, ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is the only supported metric. See `notebooks/stm.ipynb` for working examples of computing CBF from high-speed video.
